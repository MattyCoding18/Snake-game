# 🐍 Matty's Snake Game

---

## 📌 Overview
This project is a simple **Snake Game** built using Python's **Turtle** module. The game allows players to control a growing snake, eat food, and avoid collisions with the walls and itself.

The goal is to survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score!

## ✨ Features
- 🎮 **Smooth Snake Movement** using the arrow keys
- 🍏 **Food Consumption** to grow the snake and increase score
- 🔄 **Self-Collision Detection** for game over conditions
- 🏆 **Scoreboard Tracking** with real-time updates
- 🎨 **Colorful Snake** with randomly assigned segment colors
- ⏳ **Dynamic Speed Control** for smooth gameplay
